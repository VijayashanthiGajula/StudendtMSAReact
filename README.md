  # Planning 
    I am planning to build a school management system with two user roles i.e, Admin and student, multiple Intakes, multiple courses in each Intake.
    Basic Features: 
    A student can enroll into multiple course an.
    Admin can perform CRUD operations on Intakes, Courses and can view Students.
  # Proud moment: 
     I have successfully merged the nack end and front end this time. I used to struggle at that. I have worked on .Net MVC full-stack project with EF core and Database support and plain front end with react.Always struggle with integrating react with .Net back end. I have achieved it.
  # Basic features.
    react with Type script    
    Material UI for styling react components
    responsive web design that suits for diff view ports
    Used react Router for redirecting through the web pages
    .Net API Endpoints
    Integrated to SQL DB using EF core ORM
    Used dependency Injection and followed the repository patter while creating the repositories of Course and Intakes.
    Used Code first approach and started by seeding some data into Courses and Intakes.
    All CRUD operation can pe performed on course and intakes
    Git Hub is Used for Version controlling. Maintained proper time to time log of commits after each important mile stone of my project.  
     
  # Advanced Features: 
  Used Redux and react hooks for state management while performing CRUD operations
  Switching to Different themes is available
  Unit Testing , Integration testing ( tried to apply unit and integration testing for main App component. Still in progress for othe components. Due to force installation of jest currently test stopped running properly but app and index test files were running and succeeded before.)
  Aiming for 
  Containerizing the app.
  Deploying on Azure  

  # Future Improvements of the project
     A student can Register, Login and enroll into a course.
     Admin can  can Register, Login, and can access the intakes , courses, students list.
   ## Sprint 1 Backlogs:
   ### Back End
     Creating Repositories and models for Intake, Course using ASP.Net Core and its dependency injection,
     Creating API end points of Intake, Course using ASP.Net core API controllers,     
     Integrating EF core to map the peristent data from SQL Server ( Code first approach),
     Git hub version controlling.
   ### Front End
     React JS with TypeScript for Type-Safety, 
     React hooks for handling data and handling side effects,
     Axios for http requests,
     React router for routing 
     Material UI for styling responsive UI components and React redux for state management.  
     Dark and Light modes
     Github versions controlling ( UI -storybook optional)
     
   ## Sprint 2 Backlogs:
   ### Advanced features and deployment migration
     Code Identity for Admin and studnet authenticity and authorization services. (Registration and login along with Roles)
     Data migration to AZURE SQL
     Docker Containerazation
     Website depolyment on Azure Web apps      

  # Technologies I am going to use in this project
    Front End: React app with Type Script, Material UI, react Libraries (React hooks, React Redux)
    Back End: Rest API,.Net 8.0, C#, EF Core,Repository pattern 
    Database: SQL server(DEV), Azure SQL(Pro)
    Version Controlling: Git HUB.
    Deployment: AZURE web apps and Azure SQL
